1) a for() loop takes elements from the while() loop and puts them in linear order.
2) the four parts of a for() loop are: the initilization, the condition, the incrementation,
    and the final object that's being affected. The initilization sets a variable for 
    the object, the condition sets parameters for the command, and the incrementation dictates
    how the variable is being affected throughout the canvas, finally the object or command 
    is what is being looped in the for() loop.
3) nested means a loop within a loop, so a loop command which is written within an initial loop, and
    which only works when the first loop is fired.
